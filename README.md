# FLAMA code:
( [F]orcefie[L]d [A]djust[M]ent [A]lgorithm )

This code adjusts interatomic potentials from a reference database of atomic structures and their corresponding DFT energies. For the calculation of energies from atomic positions, it uses the GULP or LAMMPS program via an interface. The adjustment of the potentials is done by means of a genetic algorithm. The code has been tested for the calculation of interatomic potentials of perovskites PbCs(Br,I,Cl)3 and Pb(MA,FA,Cs)(Br,I)3. The calculation of the reference database of energies and geometries was calculated using the VASP code.
